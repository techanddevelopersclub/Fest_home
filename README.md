## 🎨 Customization

### Tailwind Configuration
Customize the theme in `tailwind.config.js`:
```javascript
module.exports = {
  theme: {
    extend: {
      // Add your custom styles here
    },
  },
}
```

### Adding Components
Create new components in the `src/components/` directory and import them where needed.

## 🔧 Build & Deployment

### Build for Production
```bash
npm run build
```

This creates an optimized production build in the `dist` folder.

### Deploy
You can deploy the `dist` folder to any static hosting service:
- **Vercel**: `vercel --prod`
- **Netlify**: Drag & drop the `dist` folder
- **GitHub Pages**: Use `gh-pages` package
- **Firebase Hosting**: `firebase deploy`

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Port Already in Use
If port 5173 is already in use, Vite will automatically try the next available port.

### Dependencies Issues
```bash
# Clear cache and reinstall
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```

### Build Errors
Ensure all dependencies are installed and Node.js version is compatible:
```bash
node --version  # Should be v16 or higher
npm --version
```
